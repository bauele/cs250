Repository for my CS-250 class

Throughout this course, I have learned how to address the following:

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

The best way to do this is by communicating directly with the end users of the application. In doing so, I can determine what specific value the end user is hoping to obtain. Afterwards, I can place myself in their shoes and begin writing user stories using the format: "As a <role>, I want to <action>, so that I can <result>." Doing this will allow me to focus on what the user wants and enable me to plan the best way to deliver that value.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
  
Typically, I would approach developing programs by cherry-picking features based on whatever it was I wanted to work on that day. Going forward, however, I will be focusing more on creating specific increments of value rather than working all over the place. Even in the early stages of an application it can be possible to deliver a small, focused, yet still valuable piece of functionality. 
  
**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
  
Communication and collaboration are key in being a good team member in any software development environment. It is important to call out issues as they arise, but also to celebrate successes. It is important that everyone on the team has the same goals and values in mind, and that they can trust each other to hold up their end of the work.
